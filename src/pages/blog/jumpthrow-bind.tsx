        <h2>Is jumpthrow bind legal?</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/jumpthrow-bind">
            Yes
          </a>
          , mostly. In matchmaking, ESEA, FACEIT and most pro tournaments the
          jump throw bind is legal to use. However, if your playing on some pro
          or semi-pro tournament, double-check their rules to be sure you’re not
          breaking any rules.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the jumpthrow bind?</h2>
        <p>
          The jumpthrow bind is a small script you can bind to one of your
          buttons. It allows you with one click of a button to perform multiple
          actions. In the case of the jumpthrow bind, these actions are jumping
          and releasing the left mouse button at the same time. So why is this
          so useful? It allows you to throw long-range with the same outcome
          every time. If you try to jump and release the nade yourself without
          the bind, you will see some variations for your throws as your not a
          robot, and you probably release the mouse button at slightly different
          times.
        </p>

        <h2>Setting up jumpthrow bind</h2>
        <p>
          If you don’t have a autoexec config file allready, you can follow{" "}
          <a href="https://www.dailyesports.gg/how-to-create-a-custom-csgo-config-autoexec-cfg/">
            this guide
          </a>{" "}
          to set it up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paste the following into your autoexec file, change out KEY with
          whatever button you prefer:
        </p>
        <BlogCodeSnippet
          code={
            'alias "+jumpthrow" "+jump;-attack;-attack2"\nalias "-jumpthrow" "-jump"\nbind "KEY" "+jumpthrow"'
          }
        />

        <div className="a-tag">
          <AdUnit tagType="728x90" />
        </div>

        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <p>
          Take out your smoke, hold down either your left, right or both mouse
          buttons. Then press the button you selected for your bind. The script
          will jump, and release both mouse buttons for you.
        </p>

        <b>Normal range jumpthrow</b>
        <p>
          Hold down <em>left mouse button</em>, click the bind.
        </p>

        <b>Short range jumpthrow</b>
        <p>
          Holde down <em>right mouse button</em>, click the bind.
        </p>

        <b>Medium range jumpthrow</b>
        <p>
          Holde down <em>both mouse button</em>, click the bind.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
